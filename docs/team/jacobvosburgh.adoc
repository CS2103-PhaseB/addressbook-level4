=== Enhancement Added: Delete Button

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=deleteButton]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Visual displays inherently encourage us to interact with them. As such, I simplified the deleting process by adding a
delete button, allowing users to quickly remove people from their list.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Edit Button

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=editButton]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Edit commands are a huge pain to type out, since they force you to remember the prefix needed for each
data type involved. This process is made much easier with the new edit button and it's edit window.
