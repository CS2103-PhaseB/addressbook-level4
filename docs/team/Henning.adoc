== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
AddressBook - Level 4 is an address book application, that allows the user
to store all their contacts in a simple manner. It mainly interacts with the user
through a command line interface, but it also implements a simple GUI. It is written in Java.

*Code contributed*: https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T13-B2/main/blob/fixing1.5/collated/main/Henning.md

=== Enhancement Added: Group score parameter and expanded sort command

The group score parameter allows the user to rate users in the addressbook on a
scale from 0-9, with 9 being the best and 0 being the worst. +
This rating is meant to reflect how well the user believes they would work together
with the given person in a group, and can be based on different criteria such as
academic ability, personality etc. This score will then be displayed on the person card
of the individual. +
Furthermore, the group score parameter has been integrated with the sort command,
which allows the user to sort their addressbook by group score in descending order.

==== Justification

Our addressbook's target consumer base is mainly university students. In line with this
vision, the group score parameter was added. Because of its integration with the sort command,
it is a nice feature for students to have, since it then allows them to sort their entire
addressbook by group score. This can be essential when students need to form a group
for an important project, as it allows for a quick overview of the persons that
would be most desirable to form a group with, such that the best result can be achieved.

==== Implementation

The score parameter is implemented much like the other parameters in the Addressbook.
The main difference is how it handles no input. Since the group score is optional,
it allows for this. When no input is received in the AddCommandParser, the
parseScore method in the ParserUtil class will return an empty string object. When
the new Score object is being instantiated, this will then be recognized, and the empty
string will be assigned as the new score's value. This means no score will
be displayed for that person in the addressbook, but it will still be possible to
add one with the edit command later on.
